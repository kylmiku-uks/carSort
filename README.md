Technical test assignment

It is currently possible to launch the project from the IDE (I used IntelliJ for developing this). When attempting to export the project to the executable .jar file, I encountered problems with launching the file (main class was not found). Since it is late already, I cannot continue investigating this problem, hopefully you will be able to run the application one way or another.
